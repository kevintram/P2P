A P2P network based off of BitTorrent.

To run:
- build project (in intelliJ)
- cd into out/artifacts/P2P_jar
- run "java -jar P2P.jar <peer id>"

I hard coded the peer id's. They start at 1001. So, in order for this to run properly, run first with peer id 1001, then in a seperate terminal window run with 1002 and so on.
